## Overview
The `appdynamics` command supports pulling metrics from AppDynamics.  It uses the [AppDynamicsREST](https://github.com/tradel/AppDynamicsREST/) client to interact with AppDynamics.

## Usage
1. Install the [Wavefront Collector] pip install wavefront_collector (https://pypi.python.org/pypi/wavefront_collector)
2. Install [AppDynamicsREST] pip install AppDynamicsREST (https://github.com/tradel/AppDynamicsREST)
3. Copy `appdynamics.conf` from `appdynamics-sample-configuration` to a directory of your choosing
4. Open `appdynamics.conf` in an editor and update the `api`, `filter`, and `writer` sections.  (See below for details)
5. Run the Wavefront Collector:
```wf -c wavefront-collector.conf```
